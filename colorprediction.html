        <h2>Aaronson Oracle</h2>
        <p>
          An Aaronson Oracle is a concept introduced by the theoretical physicist and computer scientist Scott Aaronson.
          It refers to a hypothetical computational oracle that can predict the outcome of certain events or actions,
          based on statistical patterns or historical data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of this Color Prediction Oracle, the Aaronson Oracle attempts to predict the next color
          you will choose based on the frequency of your previous color choices.
          It uses a simple statistical model to make predictions, updating its model with each new user choice.
          The Correct Prediction Percentage provides insights into the performance of the prediction model.

          In a class I taught at Berkeley, I did an experiment where I wrote a simple little program that would
          let people type either “f” or “d” and would predict which key they were going to push next.
          It’s actually very easy to write a program that will make the right prediction about 70% of the time.
          Most people don’t really know how to type randomly. They’ll have too many alternations and so on.
          There will be all sorts of patterns, so you just have to build some sort of probabilistic model.
          Even a very crude one will do well. I couldn’t even beat my own program, knowing exactly how it worked.
          I challenged people to try this and the program was getting between 70% and 80% prediction rates.
          Then, we found one student that the program predicted exactly 50% of the time. We asked him
          what his secret was and he responded that he “just used his free will.”

          Instead of the original example used by Aarinson that worked by typing letters, we chose to go
          with two buttons for ease of use on mobile. The core concept, however, is still the same. We even went as
          far as to add a 'Free Will Rating' to denote how undpredictably you are able to choose between the two.

        <h2>Free Will Rating</h2>
        <p>
          The Free Will Rating is a measure of the perceived freedom in your color choices
          compared to the predictions made by the Aaronson Oracle.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is calculated as follows:
          For every percentage point the Correct Prediction Percentage is above or below 50%,
          the Free Will Rating decreases by 2%.
          A higher Free Will Rating indicates a higher perceived freedom in your color choices.
