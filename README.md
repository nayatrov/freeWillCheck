Simple implementation of an Aaronson Oracle, first discussed in 'Quantum Computing Since Democritus.'

The code used by Aaronson and friends for the original implementation used a 5-gram (avg of last five moves)
to calculate the moving average and guess the option picked by the next user, describing more complex options
others could try to implement for more accuracy, but I am lazy and just went with pure average because at the 
time I was rusty and couldn't be bothered with anything else.

Hadn't coded in a while so went with pure HTML for a tiny simple project before getting back into React and Next.
Don't judge at how simplistic everything looks, I promise I have some much better looking sites in my private
repos now, and if you'd like me to prove this statement just message me and ask for some of the URLs.
